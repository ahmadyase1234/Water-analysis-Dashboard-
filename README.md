# Water Dashboard - Power BI Project

## Overview

The **Water Dashboard** is an interactive business intelligence solution built using Power BI, aiming to monitor and analyze key indicators related to **water usage, sources, and consumption patterns**. This report empowers decision-makers with real-time insights to support sustainable water management, detect irregularities, and enhance operational planning.

## Project Objectives

- Monitor total water consumption over time.
- Identify high-consumption areas or categories.
- Analyze the contribution of each water source to the overall supply.
- Support strategic planning and sustainability initiatives.
- Detect anomalies or inefficiencies in water usage.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for non-technical stakeholders.

## Key Features

### 1. **KPI Section**
- **Total Water Consumption**: Displays the total amount of water consumed within the selected period.
- **Average Daily Consumption**: Helps evaluate usage patterns.
- **Water Loss/Leak Detection** *(if included)*: Highlights discrepancies between supplied and consumed water.

### 2. **Time Analysis**
- Monthly or daily trends using line and bar charts.
- Comparison between current and previous periods.

### 3. **Geographic/Location Breakdown**
- Water usage by **region, branch, or facility**.
- Enables detection of areas with high or abnormal usage.

### 4. **Water Source Analysis**
- Breakdown by water source type (e.g., Groundwater, River, Municipal Supply).
- Helps assess reliance on different sources and sustainability implications.

### 5. **User-Friendly Slicers**
- Dynamic filters for:
  - Time periods (month, year)
  - Locations
  - Usage category (domestic, industrial, agricultural, etc.)
  - Water source

### 6. **Clean Visual Design**
- Consistent color schemes
- Clear labels and tooltips
- Responsive layout

## Data Sources

- Internal water consumption records (e.g., Excel, CSV)
- Cleaned and transformed using Power Query Editor

## Technologies Used

- **Power BI Desktop**
- **DAX** for KPIs and time intelligence calculations
- **Power Query (M)** for data transformation
